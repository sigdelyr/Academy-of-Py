# PyCity Schools 

Analysis of School and Student data  (Charter vs. District).


# Tools / Technologies used: Python, Pandas Library, and Jupyter Notebook


# Summary

Used pandas to analyze district-wide standardized test results. The data was agregated to examine for trends in school performance (70% or higher is a passing score (meaning greater than or equal to 70). The final report were created; district summary, school summary, top performing schools (by passing rate), bottom performing schools (by passing rate), math scores by grade, reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type.

# Finding

The final data (scores by school type), Charter schools performed well than the District schools. Overall there is a 95% passing rate (in math and reading skills) in the Charter schools, compared to an almost 74% proficiency in the District schools. 

If we observe the data scores by schools (spending, size & type), reading skills are found more enhanced than math skills.

With the Scores by School Spending, it does not seems considerably correlation between school spending and average of math or reading scores.
