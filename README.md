# PyCity Schools Data Summary

As we observe the final data (scores by school type), Charter schools performed well than the District schools. Overall there is a 95% passing rate (in math and reading skills) in the Charter schools, compared to an almost 74% proficiency in the District schools. 

If we observe the data scores by schools (spending, size & type), reading skills are found more enhanced than math skills.

With the Scores by School Spending, it does not seems considerably correlation between school spending and average of math or reading scores.
